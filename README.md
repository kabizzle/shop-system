# Shop System

Programming task for ELEC-A7100 Basic course in C programming (Spring 2022)

I implemented a shop bookkeeping system, which stores data in two different ways: in binary and text files.

The products of the shop are stored in an array of 'Product' struct elements.

The program contains:

- write_binary function - writes the product array to a binary file
- read_binary function - reads the shop's products from a binary file
- write_plaintext - writes the shop's products to a text file
- read_plaintext - reads the shop's products from a text file
